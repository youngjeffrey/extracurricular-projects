_Color Clicker Game_

The Color Clicker is a game I am currently working on where the player is presented with a grid of red squares
and has to pick the odd one out. The higher the level, the more similar the odd square's color will be to that
of red. The code uses Tkinter as the frame for the game and relies on method calls to perform the actions. 
I plan on implementing the color change for the odd square, adding a timer, and improving the aesthetics
in the near future. 

_Interactive Dictionary_

The Interactive Dictionary is a Python based application where the user can search up and word, press 'Define', and
the definition of the word will be given. If the user mispelled the word, the app will give a suggestion of a similar
word. The program involves parsing of Tkinter, parsing of JSON files, and difflib to compare word similarities. In 
order to run it, run App2.py in SRC. 

_Mapping USA_

Mapping USA is a Python based program that maps out geographic locations within United States like cities and volcanoes
and saves it to a .html file. It also color codes the countries, cities, and volcanoes based on population and height 
respectively. The program uses Pandas to read and parse .csv and .txt files and uses folium to draw out the map. 
In order to run the program, click on Maps.html.
