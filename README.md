_Color Clicker Game_

The Color Clicker is a game I am currently working on where the player is presented with a grid of red squares
and has to pick the odd one out. The higher the level, the more similar the odd square's color will be to that
of red. I plan on implementing the color change for the odd square, adding a timer, and improving the aesthetics
in the near future.
